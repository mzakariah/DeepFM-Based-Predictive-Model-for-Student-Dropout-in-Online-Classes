The HarvardX Person-Course Academic Year 2013 De-Identified Dataset (HMPC) is a dataset that contains information on student enrollment and performance in HarvardX courses offered through the edX platform during the academic year 2013. The dataset includes de-identified information on individual students, such as age, gender, and country of residence, as well as course-level information, such as course subjects, start and end dates, and grades. 

Study:

we designed a DeepFM-based predictive model for student dropout in online classes on the HarvardX Person-Course Academic Year 2013 De-Identified Dataset. Our model takes advantage of both factorization and deep neural networks to capture the interactions among the features and achieve high accuracy in predicting the dropout behavior of students. We evaluated our model on a test set and achieved an accuracy of 99%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model in predicting student dropout. We also compared our model with three existing approaches and found that our approach outperformed them in terms of accuracy. Additionally, our model has the advantage of being able to handle both sparse and dense features, which are common in MOOC datasets. our DeepFM-based model is a novel and effective approach for predicting student dropout in online classes. It has the potential to be applied to other MOOC datasets and help educators and institutions identify at-risk students and provide targeted interventions to improve their learning outcomes.
